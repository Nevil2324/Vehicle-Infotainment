# Vehicle-Infotainment

Welcome to the Vehicle Infotainment Screen project! This project aims to provide an user-friendly interface for modern vehicles. The infotainment screen integrates various functionalities, such as fuel level, tyre pressure, coolant level, engine(pressure, oil, oxygen) speed and map, to enhance the driving experience. Additionally, the dashboard prominently displays the current time, ensuring drivers always have this essential information at a glance.

## Features
- Real-time clock shown on the dashboard for easy viewing.
- All features of the infotainment screen are designed to provide real-time updates. Whether it's fuel level, tyre pressure, coolant level, engine, speed and map, the data displayed is always current and refreshes automatically to reflect the latest information.
